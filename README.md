# GMTK23
Team Watercooler - Minerva Wang, Andrew Mao, Randy Zhu, Jennifer Park (AKA the JJK Simps)

Designed during the two-day 2023 GMTK Game Jam with the theme of **_ROLES REVERESED_**

Description:
The Crossy Road Chicken is tired of crossing the roads alone. One day, it forms a formidable team filled with chicken, geese, and ducks - dominating the roads. Your job is to control vehicles to crash into the birds and EXTERMINATE THEM. Be fast, calculative, and meticulous before they overpopulate...and DESTROY you instead.
